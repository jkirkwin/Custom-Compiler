# Custom-Compiler
A compiler for a simple C-inspired language. Built as part of CSC 435 (Compiler Construction) at UVic.

## Tooling

Lexing and parser generation is handled by ANTLR. Note that version 3.5.2 of ANTLR was used for pedagogical reasons. Current versions of ANTLR (4+) will not work with this source code package. 

## Running the code

Once you have built or downloaded an appropriate ANTLR Jar, ensure it is in your `CLASSPATH`.
